## How AutoConnect works under the hood ?

The **AutoConnect** application relies on 2 dependencies :
1. The InternetBot class : A class I created to ease the use of [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/).
2. [tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) :  Python's standard GUI package.

The **InternetBot** class also relies on 2 dependencies :
1. [The Selenium library](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
2. the Python [os module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
